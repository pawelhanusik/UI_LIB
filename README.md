# UI_LIB

PHP scripts which make creating various UI elements faster and easier.

(right now there's only 1 script - Table)

## How-to

1. Copy `ui_lib_min` directory into your project
2. Include `ui_lib_min/ui.min.php` in your php script.

Note: Use `ui_lib` directory and `ui_lib/ui.php` file for debugging.

Have a nice day ;)
